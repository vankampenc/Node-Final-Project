# Node Final Portfolio Project

This project displays the skills and knowledge I learned throughout the Node advanced course I took through Code The Dream. The application allows users to login and register. Once a user is logged in, they are able to create, view, and edit electric vehicles (EVs) and associated information about each electric vehicle (EV).
